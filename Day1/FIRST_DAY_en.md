Learning Objectives:

- Understand the basics of Java, such as its history, features, and applications.
- Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer.
- Learn how to set up a development environment (such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans). I recommend using
  IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition because it's free and easy to use.

## Understand the basics of Java, such as its history, features, and applications.

## What is Java?

For me, Java used to be an essential tool for running Minecraft. Without it, my poor pigman friend wouldn't be able to
see me. (Just kidding!)

In terms of history, Java is a relatively old programming language that was introduced by Sun Microsystems in May

1995. (By 2023, Java will celebrate its 28th birthday, which is probably older than you!)

- It is an object-oriented programming language designed to run on different platforms without the need for
  recompilation.

- It is a widely popular programming language because it allows developers to write once and run anywhere.

- It is a robust programming language with excellent memory management and exception handling mechanisms.

## Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer.

## Learn how to set up a development environment (such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans). I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition because it's free and easy to use.
