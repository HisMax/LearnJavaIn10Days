- Understand the core principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Learn how to create classes, objects, constructors, and methods.
- Explore concepts like abstraction, interfaces, and packages.

## **Day 4: Arrays and Collections**

- Learn about arrays and how to manipulate them.
- Understand the different types of collections in Java, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashMap.

## **Day 5: Exception Handling**
